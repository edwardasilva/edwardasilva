Following this foundation, an inductive approach is employed, commencing with the first principles of electrostatics and magnetostatics (Coulomb's and Biot-Savart laws) progressing to the derivation of Maxwell's equations by incorporating Faraday's Law and the concept of displacement currents. Key topics covered include the principles underlying electric generators, AC and DC motors. This groundwork facilitates the development of circuit theory, including the establishment of conditions for its validity. The course culminates with an introduction to transmission line theory, impedance matching, and the utilization of the Smith Chart.</p>
